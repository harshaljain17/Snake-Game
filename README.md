✨ Features
Grid-Based Logic: Precision movement using a dynamic coordinate system.

Direction Buffering: Prevents "self-collision" bugs by queuing the next move, ensuring the snake can't pull a 180° turn into itself.

High Score Persistence: Uses localStorage to keep track of your best runs even after refreshing the browser.

Responsive Board: Automatically calculates rows and columns based on your container size.

Collision Detection: Integrated wall-hit and self-hit logic.
